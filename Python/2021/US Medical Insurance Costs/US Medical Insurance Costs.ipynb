    "Hello guys! My name is Madhav Menon and I am 15 years old. This is my attempt at my first Portfolio Project, \"US Medical Insurance Costs\" from Codecademy as part of the Data Science career path. This is the question I want to analyse:\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Question:**</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "*How many people in the given dataset are smokers and how does their insurance charge differ from non-smokers*\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Goals**</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "- To figure out the number of smokers in our given dataset.\n",
    "- To calculate their insurance charges and compare this to non-smokers to see how smoking can affect insurance costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Hypothesis**</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "I predict that there will be a drastic increase in insurance costs for smokers as opposed to non smokers, this would enable us to create some sort of promotional content such as flyers, advertisements etc. which will allow us to highlight the negative impacts of smoking on people's wallets and health. Cigarettes tend to be a demerit good but for some also tend to be an inelastic good so the economic analysis might be covered here as well. In conclusion, I hope that this information will enable us to reduce the number of smokers.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u> **Dataset**</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "I will need a dataset that contains mostly two columns, whether they are a smoker and their insurance costs. Luckily Codecademy has given us a dataset from Kaggle which gives more information such as their age, bmi, and sex.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>**Direction of analysis**</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will have to analyse the insurance costs of smokers and compare this to the insurance ocsts of non smokers. This will give a clear idea as to how smoking can affect the insurance costs of individuals. This may allow us to create awareness on the negative impacts of smoking. We can also conduct smaller studies such as the average age of smokers within the dataset, this may give us a rough idea of when people start smoking so necessary government action can be taken. We could also find out how many smokers have kids, this could lead to a whole different study of how parents' smoking can affect kids."

    "Clearly these two methods don't work for a variety of reasons. The first method didn't work because there are a lesser number of smokers as opposed to non smokers. Therefore there would be a higher frequency to add for non smokers which resulted in a higher total insurance cost. My explanation for method 2 will be more coherent. As there are more non smokers, there is a higher number you have to divide your charges by. This results in a small number as opposed to smokers who only have to divide by 274."

    "The initial research question was to find out how the insurance costs of smokers compared to the insurance costs of non smokers. I quickly found out after writing a few lines of code that my results cannot be reliable as we cannot have all the other variables constant. We were trying to measure the difference in insurance cost and we got the most reliable answer by adding many restrictions to our dataset. There are some clear flaws with this as we restricted the age to 18. How would this change for larger ages? The data showed that there was a 12000 dollar difference in insurance costs between smokers and non smokers following the givenr estrictions. This somewhat supported my hypothesis that smokers would have a larger insurance cost as opposed to non smokers. There are still many probing questions to conduct but instead I stumbled upon some pretty alarming information. I found out that 39 people in the dataset are underaged smokers. This calls for action from the relevant authorities as even having 1 underaged smoker is bad. However this isn't an ideal world but we have to try our best."

    "Overall I had lots of fun analysing this dataset. There was a lot of information and I usd a bit of help online. I was able to somewhat answer my questions but I know that it isn't very reliable. I would definitely analyse this again and look at a different aspect such as how the insurance cost for people with high BMIs differ to those with lower BMIs. I also had a lot of fun exploring Jupyter Notebook and I will definitely used this in further portfolio projects."
